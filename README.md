This is a short top-down adventure game made using JavaFX. This game was made in collaboration with
Alexander Ivanov as our final project for the course 2D Game Engines. The engine was built by us over the 
course of a semester. Game specific code can be found in `/projects/final_project` and the game engine
code is in `/engine`.

In order to play the game for yourself, clone the repository to your device and simply double click the 
file `final-project-slippy.jar` to launch the game. Instructions for how to play the game are included in
the menu.
